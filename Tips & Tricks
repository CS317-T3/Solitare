Don't move the same card twice in a row
When a card can be moved to the foundation, move it to the foundation.
The last card in a pile should be moved before moving from the longest tableau set.
When playing on the tableau add and remove cards from tableau 7 - 1.
Always move a king to an open tableau if available
Move Cards in tableau before moving cards from the waste
If there's nothing that can be moved, flip a card from the waste.
If there's nothing playable in the waste, see if you can drag a card from the foundation
