We as a team ended up deciding that moving cards around the tableau to get as many cards face up as possible gave us the best chance of winning games,
and I think that is true because it gives us the least chance to get aces or low numbers stuck at the bottom of piles.
Our second most important thing is that we consistently move cards to the foundations instead of simply moving things around in the tableau whenever possible,
This was implemented by having the first thing we do when looking at a new card from the waste be whether or not we can place it in the tableau, or moving aces automicatically
no matter where they are.
Our third strategy was to get as many cards out of the waste as possible in into the tableaus if we can.  If we are able to get all the cards into the tableau then the game can
always be won so we made it a point to get as many things into the tableau as possible.

Other strategies we have come up with as a team but did not have the time to implement would be removing cards from the foundation back to the tableau in order to help a new card
be turned face up and to prevent things getting stuck, and Moving kings automatically to any open tableaus (instead we just move any card to open tableaus).
